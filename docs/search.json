The present study examines the extent to which the good target\nis consistent across two domains and two contexts as well as how being\nperceived accurately is moderated by target well-being. We found support\nfor the theory that the good target generalizes across both contexts and\ndomains and also found evidence for a likable target. Target well-being\nwas not consistently associated with the good target across contexts and\ndomains, though target well-being was a consistent moderator for the\nlikable target.\n\nWessels et al. (2020)\n\nA great range of person perception phenomena may be conceptualized in\nterms of how much perceivers know about the targets, how much they like\nthe targets, and how these factors relate to the extent to which target\ndescriptions reflect actual target characteristics and/or evaluative\nbias. Using multilevel profile analyses, we investigated how liking and\nknowing are differentially associated with judgments’ normative accuracy\n(i.e., reflecting actual characteristics of the average target),\ndistinctive accuracy (i.e., reflecting actual characteristics of\nspecific targets), and positivity bias. Despite being positively\ncorrelated with one another, liking and knowing had opposing effects on\nperson judgments: Knowing targets better was associated with greater\ndistinctive and normative accuracy, and with lower positivity bias. In\ncontrast, liking targets more was associated with lower distinctive and\nnormative accuracy, but with greater positivity bias. The findings\nsuggest that person judgments tend to reflect actual target\ncharacteristics as well as evaluative bias.\n\nRogers &\nBiesanz (2019)\n\nAre some people truly better able to accurately perceive the\npersonality of others? Previous research suggests that the good judge\nmay be of little practical importance and individual differences\nminimal. In four large samples we assessed whether expressive accuracy\n(the good target) is a necessary condition for perceptive accuracy (the\ngood judge) to emerge. As predicted from Funder’s (1995) realistic\naccuracy model, assessments of the good judge predicted increased\nimpression accuracy in the context of judgments of the good target. The\npresent results suggest the good judge does indeed exist—some\nindividuals are much better able to detect and utilize valid cues from\ntargets—but this is only strongly evident when perceiving a good\ntarget.\n\nMagee &\nBiesanz (2018)\n\nAlthough there is a robust connection between dispositional\npersonality traits and well-being, relatively little research has\ncomprehensively examined the ways in which all Big Five personality\nstates are associated with short-term experiences of well-being within\nindividuals. We address three central questions about the nature of the\nrelationship between personality and well-being states: First, to what\nextent do personality and well-being states covary within individuals?\nSecond, to what extent do personality and well-being states influence\none another within individuals? Finally, are these within-person\nrelationships moderated by dispositional personality traits and\nwell-being? Across two experience sampling studies, all Big Five\npersonality states were correlated with short-term experiences of\nwell-being within individuals. Individuals were more extraverted,\nemotionally stable, conscientious, agreeable, and open in moments when\nthey experienced higher well-being (greater self-esteem, life\nsatisfaction and positive affect, and less negative affect). Moreover,\npersonality and well-being states dynamically influenced one another\nover time within individuals, and these associations were not generally\nmoderated by dispositional traits or well-being. In short, behavior and\nwell-being are interconnected within the context of the Big Five model\nof personality.\n\nRogers & Biesanz\n(2015)\n\nThere are strong differences between individuals in the tendency to\nview the personality of others as similar to the average person. That\nis, some people tend to form more normatively accurate impressions than\ndo others. Individuals may achieve high normative accuracy by viewing\nothers as similar to the average person or by viewing them in an overly\nsocially desirable manner. The average self-reported personality profile\nand social desirability, despite being strongly correlated,\nindependently and strongly predict first impressions. Further, some\nindividuals have a more accurate understanding of the average\nindividual’s personality than do others. Perceivers with more accurate\nknowledge about the average individual’s personality rated the\npersonality of specific others more normatively accurately (more similar\nto the average person), suggesting that individual differences in\nnormative judgments include a component of accurate knowledge regarding\nthe average personality. In contrast, perceivers who explicitly\nevaluated others more positively formed more socially desirable\nimpressions, but not more normatively accurate impressions.\n\n\n\n\nMagee, C., & Biesanz, J.

      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\nResearch Areas\nResearch in SAL falls into 3 broad categories. First are questions\nabout accuracy and bias in person perception using the Social Accuracy\nModel (SAM).\nFor instance, when, why, and how are first impressions of others more or\nless accurate? Are some people more likeable than others and what are\nthe consequences of likeability? Second, what is the nature and\nstructure of personality? How can we better assess basic personality\ntraits and dimensions? How does personality manifest over time? Finally,\nwe are interested in developing, improving, and disseminating better\nquantitative tools for substantive researchers to improve the practice\nof psychological science.\n\nAccuracy and Bias\nWe are currently examining the overall levels, variability, and the\ninterrelationships between multiple forms of accuracy and bias. Although\naccuracy and biases such as assumed similarity and self-enhancement have\nlong research histories, rarely have these processes been studied\nsimultaneously, nor have there been adequate techniques to directly\ncompare the variability and relationships between these processes.\nUtilizing SAM, we are able to examine the extent to which bias and\naccuracy are interrelated or opposing processes.\nMotivation\nWe have also been exploring whether social goals, such as the\nmotivation to form more accurate impressions, can improve the accuracy\nof impressions. Indeed, it does appear that motivated perceivers are\nbetter able to perceive the unique characteristics of others. This comes\nat the cost, however, of viewing others less normatively, and, in turn,\nless positively (Biesanz & Human,\n2010). We are interested further exploring the links between\nnormative accuracy, positivity, and social relationships, to better\nunderstand the implications of this reduction in normative accuracy.\nAdjustment\nOne major line of research in our lab investigates how well-adjusted\nindividuals, those with effective personal and interpersonal\nfunctioning, perceive others and tend to be perceived by others (Human & Biesanz,\n2011; Wallace &\nBiesanz, 2021).\nAcquaintanceship\nAnother line of research has investigated whether accuracy improves\nwith greater acquaintanceship. That is, do we come to know others better\nthe longer we know them? Although overall accuracy doesn’t appear to\nimprove over time, this is because with greater acquaintanceship\ndistinctive accuracy increases but normative accuracy decreases (Biesanz et al., 2007). Thus the longer\nwe know someone, we better understand their unique characteristics while\nperceiving them as less similar to what people are like in general. To\nreplicate this finding longitudinally, we are currently examining how\nnew roommates’ impressions of one another change over time.\nImpression Management\nEven without any deliberate effort on our part, others are able to\nform rather accurate impressions about us. But what about when we try to\nmake a specific impression on others? One of our lines of research is\nexamining how self-presentation, or “putting one’s best face forward”,\nimpacts the accuracy of impressions. So far, we have found that\nindividuals’ engaging in self-presentation are actually more accurately\nperceived than those who are not, primarily because they appear to\nelicit greater attention from others (Human et al., 2012).\nQuantitative Methods and\nResearch\nMy current quantitative research is quite diverse with the unifying\ntheme of focusing on topics that require additional attention — in other\nwords, building better quantitative tools for common problems faced by\napplied researchers. Recent examples include (1) novel approaches to\nexamining mediational models (Biesanz et al.,\n2010; Falk\n& Biesanz, 2015, 2016), (2) sample size planning based on\neffect size estimates (in progress), and (3) generating confidence\nintervals for standardized effect size estimates based on both fixed and\nrandom predictors (in progress). Currently I am in the process of\ndeveloping and expanding a package for R fabs that will serve as a\nrepository of my quantitative work and code for these various\nendeavours.\nTo install fabs, download the devtools package in R and\nthen run the following code:\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(“jbiesanz/fabs”)library(fabs)`\n\n\n\nBiesanz, J.
