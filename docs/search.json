The present study examines the extent to which the good target\nis consistent across two domains and two contexts as well as how being\nperceived accurately is moderated by target well-being. We found support\nfor the theory that the good target generalizes across both contexts and\ndomains and also found evidence for a likable target. Target well-being\nwas not consistently associated with the good target across contexts and\ndomains, though target well-being was a consistent moderator for the\nlikable target.\n\nWessels et al. (2020)\n\nA great range of person perception phenomena may be conceptualized in\nterms of how much perceivers know about the targets, how much they like\nthe targets, and how these factors relate to the extent to which target\ndescriptions reflect actual target characteristics and/or evaluative\nbias. Using multilevel profile analyses, we investigated how liking and\nknowing are differentially associated with judgments’ normative accuracy\n(i.e., reflecting actual characteristics of the average target),\ndistinctive accuracy (i.e., reflecting actual characteristics of\nspecific targets), and positivity bias. Despite being positively\ncorrelated with one another, liking and knowing had opposing effects on\nperson judgments: Knowing targets better was associated with greater\ndistinctive and normative accuracy, and with lower positivity bias. In\ncontrast, liking targets more was associated with lower distinctive and\nnormative accuracy, but with greater positivity bias. The findings\nsuggest that person judgments tend to reflect actual target\ncharacteristics as well as evaluative bias.\n\nRogers &\nBiesanz (2019)\n\nAre some people truly better able to accurately perceive the\npersonality of others? Previous research suggests that the good judge\nmay be of little practical importance and individual differences\nminimal. In four large samples we assessed whether expressive accuracy\n(the good target) is a necessary condition for perceptive accuracy (the\ngood judge) to emerge. As predicted from Funder’s (1995) realistic\naccuracy model, assessments of the good judge predicted increased\nimpression accuracy in the context of judgments of the good target. The\npresent results suggest the good judge does indeed exist—some\nindividuals are much better able to detect and utilize valid cues from\ntargets—but this is only strongly evident when perceiving a good\ntarget.\n\nMagee &\nBiesanz (2018)\n\nAlthough there is a robust connection between dispositional\npersonality traits and well-being, relatively little research has\ncomprehensively examined the ways in which all Big Five personality\nstates are associated with short-term experiences of well-being within\nindividuals. We address three central questions about the nature of the\nrelationship between personality and well-being states: First, to what\nextent do personality and well-being states covary within individuals?\nSecond, to what extent do personality and well-being states influence\none another within individuals? Finally, are these within-person\nrelationships moderated by dispositional personality traits and\nwell-being? Across two experience sampling studies, all Big Five\npersonality states were correlated with short-term experiences of\nwell-being within individuals. Individuals were more extraverted,\nemotionally stable, conscientious, agreeable, and open in moments when\nthey experienced higher well-being (greater self-esteem, life\nsatisfaction and positive affect, and less negative affect). Moreover,\npersonality and well-being states dynamically influenced one another\nover time within individuals, and these associations were not generally\nmoderated by dispositional traits or well-being. In short, behavior and\nwell-being are interconnected within the context of the Big Five model\nof personality.\n\nRogers & Biesanz\n(2015)\n\nThere are strong differences between individuals in the tendency to\nview the personality of others as similar to the average person. That\nis, some people tend to form more normatively accurate impressions than\ndo others. Individuals may achieve high normative accuracy by viewing\nothers as similar to the average person or by viewing them in an overly\nsocially desirable manner. The average self-reported personality profile\nand social desirability, despite being strongly correlated,\nindependently and strongly predict first impressions. Further, some\nindividuals have a more accurate understanding of the average\nindividual’s personality than do others. Perceivers with more accurate\nknowledge about the average individual’s personality rated the\npersonality of specific others more normatively accurately (more similar\nto the average person), suggesting that individual differences in\nnormative judgments include a component of accurate knowledge regarding\nthe average personality. In contrast, perceivers who explicitly\nevaluated others more positively formed more socially desirable\nimpressions, but not more normatively accurate impressions.\n\n\n\n\nMagee, C., & Biesanz, J.

      "contents": "\n\n\n\n\nResearch Areas\nResearch in SAL falls into 3 broad categories. First are questions\nabout accuracy and bias in person perception using the Social Accuracy\nModel (SAM).\nFor instance, when, why, and how are first impressions of others more or\nless accurate? Are some people more likeable than others and what are\nthe consequences of likeability? Second, what is the nature and\nstructure of personality? How can we better assess basic personality\ntraits and dimensions? How does personality manifest over time? Finally,\nwe are interested in developing, improving, and disseminating better\nquantitative tools for substantive researchers to improve the practice\nof psychological science.\n\nAccuracy and Bias\nWe are currently examining the overall levels, variability, and the\ninterrelationships between multiple forms of accuracy and bias. Although\naccuracy and biases such as assumed similarity and self-enhancement have\nlong research histories, rarely have these processes been studied\nsimultaneously, nor have there been adequate techniques to directly\ncompare the variability and relationships between these processes.\nUtilizing SAM, we are able to examine the extent to which bias and\naccuracy are interrelated or opposing processes.\nMotivation\nWe have also been exploring whether social goals, such as the\nmotivation to form more accurate impressions, can improve the accuracy\nof impressions. Indeed, it does appear that motivated perceivers are\nbetter able to perceive the unique characteristics of others. This comes\nat the cost, however, of viewing others less normatively, and, in turn,\nless positively (Biesanz & Human,\n2010). We are interested further exploring the links between\nnormative accuracy, positivity, and social relationships, to better\nunderstand the implications of this reduction in normative accuracy.\nAdjustment\nOne major line of research in our lab investigates how well-adjusted\nindividuals, those with effective personal and interpersonal\nfunctioning, perceive others and tend to be perceived by others (Human & Biesanz,\n2011; Wallace &\nBiesanz, 2021).\nAcquaintanceship\nAnother line of research has investigated whether accuracy improves\nwith greater acquaintanceship. That is, do we come to know others better\nthe longer we know them? Although overall accuracy doesn’t appear to\nimprove over time, this is because with greater acquaintanceship\ndistinctive accuracy increases but normative accuracy decreases (Biesanz et al., 2007). Thus the longer\nwe know someone, we better understand their unique characteristics while\nperceiving them as less similar to what people are like in general. To\nreplicate this finding longitudinally, we are currently examining how\nnew roommates’ impressions of one another change over time.\nImpression Management\nEven without any deliberate effort on our part, others are able to\nform rather accurate impressions about us. But what about when we try to\nmake a specific impression on others? One of our lines of research is\nexamining how self-presentation, or “putting one’s best face forward”,\nimpacts the accuracy of impressions. So far, we have found that\nindividuals’ engaging in self-presentation are actually more accurately\nperceived than those who are not, primarily because they appear to\nelicit greater attention from others (Human et al., 2012).\nQuantitative Methods and\nResearch\nMy current quantitative research is quite diverse with the unifying\ntheme of focusing on topics that require additional attention — in other\nwords, building better quantitative tools for common problems faced by\napplied researchers. Recent examples include (1) novel approaches to\nexamining mediational models (Biesanz et al.,\n2010; Falk\n& Biesanz, 2015, 2016), (2) sample size planning based on\neffect size estimates (in progress), and (3) generating confidence\nintervals for standardized effect size estimates based on both fixed and\nrandom predictors (in progress). Currently I am in the process of\ndeveloping and expanding a package for R fabs that will serve as a\nrepository of my quantitative work and code for these various\nendeavours. fabs is\ncurrently available on github and will soon be submitted as a package on\nCRAN.\nTo install fabs, download the devtools package in R and\nthen run the following code:\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(“jbiesanz/fabs”)library(fabs)\n\n\n\nBiesanz, J.

      "contents": "\nThe social accuracy model (SAM) is a model that estimates individual\ndifferences in aspects of interpersonal perception. SAM is a\ncomponential model of accuracy breaks assessments of accuracy into\ndifferent elements (components) that have specific and hopefully useful\ninterpretations. Perceiver and target effects refer to estimates of\naccuracy components for each perceiver (averaged across targets) and\neach target (averaged across perceivers) and are analogous to main\neffects in ANOVA. Dyadic effects are simply the residual effect that is\nleft over for each dyad after accounting for the perceiver and target\naverage effects. For instance, Percy may have a large perceiver effect\nin that she is generally accurate in her perceptions of the personality\nof others and thus high in perceptive accuracy. Taylor may have a large\ntarget effect is is generally perceived accurately by others.\n\nA copy of Biesanz (2021) along with annotated R code and data can be\nfound on OSF.\nConceptually, SAM represents an integration of Cronbach’s (1955) componential approach to assessing\naccuracy with Kenny’s (Kenny, 1994; Kenny & La Voie, 1984) social\nrelations model. To do this, SAM adopts Funder’s (1995) realistic accuracy model (RAM) for\nmodeling accuracy in that the goal is to assess the validity of the\nperceiver’s impressions. Initial elements of SAM can be seen in earlier\nwork (e.g., Biesanz et al.,\n1998, 2007; Biesanz & West,\n2000) that adapted Cronbach’s components of accuracy. Biesanz (2010)\nprovided the first overview of the social accuracy model as a general\nmodel that can provide answers to questions, such as those raised in\nFunder (1995), that\ncannot be addressed through other frameworks or models. Since then, SAM\nhas been used extensively to examine many different research questions\nin our lab as well as by others.\nThe Basic Social Accuracy\nModel\n\nFor a brief and gentle introduction to multilevel models see the lecture\nnotes and code from the APS multilevel\nworkshop I conducted in 2019.\nThere are only two measures that are needed for the social accuracy\nmodel: perceiver ratings/impressions of the target and target validity\nmeasures. These measures are needed for a set of different items or\ntraits. Larger sets of items and more items will produce more reliable\nresults. In Equation (1), perceiver ratings are \\(Y_{pti}\\) which indicate perceiver \\(p\\)’s ratings of target \\(t\\) on item \\(i\\). The target validity measure for target\n\\(t\\) on item \\(i\\) is \\(V_{ti}\\). Validity measures should be as\nreliable as possible (e.g., averaged across multiple sources such as\npeer and self-reports). These are the only two assessments that are\nneeded for a social accuracy model analysis. However, to conduct the\nanalysis requires separating out the validity measure into two different\ncomponents — the average person’s validity measure and how different the\ntarget is from the average person. First, the average validity measure\nacross targets is determined for each item \\((Vmean_{i}= {\\bar{V}}_i)\\) by calculating\nthe mean for each item across the \\(t\\)\ntargets on \\(V_{ti}\\). This provides\nthe mean validity profile which is the profile of the average target.\nThe validity profile of the average target, \\(Vmean_{i}\\), is then used to center the\ntarget validity measure within items by calculating \\(Vc_{ti} = V_{ti} - Vmean_{i}\\). The\ncentered validity measures for each target and the average validity\nprofile are then used to predict the perceivers’ ratings as shown in\nEquation (1). All that is required to actually estimate\nEquation (1) is a research design where multiple\nperceivers evaluate multiple targets across a large set of items. This\ncould be a round-robin design where each perceiver meets and evaluates\nevery target, a half-block design where a set of perceivers all evaluate\na common set of targets (e.g., all of the perceivers watch and evaluate\nthe same 10 targets in videos), or various hybrids of these designs.\nFormally this is a crossed-random effects model and can be estimated\nwith standard multilevel model software.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nY_{pti} = \\gamma_{0_{pt}} + \\gamma_{1_{pt}}Vc_{ti} +\n\\gamma_{2_{pt}}Vmean_{i} + e_{pti}\n  \\tag{1}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\gamma_{0_{pt}} = \\gamma_{00} + u_{0_p} + u_{0_t} + u_{0_{(pt)}}\\\\\n\\gamma_{1_{pt}} = \\gamma_{10} + u_{1_p} + u_{1_t} + u_{1_{(pt)}}\\\\\n\\gamma_{2_{pt}} = \\gamma_{20} + u_{2_p} + u_{2_t} + u_{2_{(pt)}}\n\\end{split}\n  \\tag{2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nEquation (1) provides the full social accuracy model\nwhich is simply a two-predictor regression equation: validity measures,\ncentered within item, and the average target validity profile are used\nto predict perceiver impressions. The unstandardized regression\ncoefficients from this two-predictor regression equation, denoted by\ngamma (e.g., \\(\\gamma_{0}\\), \\(\\gamma_{1}\\), and \\(\\gamma_{2}\\)) as is the common notational\npractice for multilevel models, can vary across perceivers, targets, and\ndyads, and are captured by the \\(u\\)s\nin Equation (2).\nFixed Effects. The fixed effects represent the\naverage relationship across perceivers and targets. These coefficients\nrepresent the (weighted) average two-predictor regression model\ncoefficients across perceivers and targets. Specifically, given the\ngrand mean centering of both validity measures:\n\\(\\hat{\\gamma}_{00}\\) is the\npredicted rating at the mean validity measure for the average\npersonality item. This is often not of substantive import.\n\\(\\hat{\\gamma}_{10}\\) is the\naverage distinctive accuracy slope across perceivers and targets and\nitems. This estimates the average relationship between how the target\nt is different from the average person on the validity measures\nacross a series of traits and perceiver p’s impressions of the\ntarget on those same traits. Distinctive accuracy assesses the\nperceiver’s ability to accurately recognize the unique characteristics\nof the target. In other words, on average in the present sample, how\naccurate was this group of perceivers in recognizing the unique traits\nof this group of targets?\n\\(\\hat{\\gamma}_{20}\\) is the\naverage normative accuracy slope across perceivers and targets. This\nestimates the average relationship between the average target on the\nvalidity measures across a series of traits and the perceiver’s\nimpressions of the target on those same dimensions. In other words, on\naverage in the present sample, how accurate was this group of perceivers\nin recognizing the average target’s personality? This represents a blend\nof positivity as well as normative knowledge and recent work has shown\nthat these represent different effects and processes (Rogers & Biesanz,\n2015; Wessels et\nal., 2020). SAM can easily be extended by separating out\nnormativity and positivity in the modeling process by simply adding the\nsocial desirability of each personality trait (item) into the\nmodel.\n\nRandom Effects. The random effects represent\nvariability attributable to perceiver, targets, and dyads around the\nfixed effects. For instance, \\(\\hat{\\tau}_{1_t}\\) represents the standard\ndeviation in distinctive accuracy — good target scores \\((u_{1_t})\\) — after adjusting for sampling\nvariability. These random effects are one of the core elements of SAM as\nthey represent estimates of the extent to which people differ\nfrom each other in their ability to form accurate impressions of each\nother as well as be accurately seen by others. Potential moderators\n(i.e., correlates) of these individual differences can be added to\nEquation (2) to better understand who more accurately\nperceives others and who is more accurately perceived.\n\nTests for random effects can be made by examining the difference in\nmodel fits with a restricted model where that specific random effect is\nremoved from the model. This results in a \\(\\chi^2\\)-test whose \\(p\\)-value should be halved as tests of\nrandom variances are one-tailed (see West et al., 2011, p. 29 for more discussion of\nthis specific issue). However, regardless of the results of null\nhypothesis significance tests, random effects should be included in the\nmodel to maintain appropriate Type I error rates and to allow the\nability to generalize to the broader population of potential perceivers\nand targets. For a more detailed discussion of the importance of\nmodeling random effects see Judd et al. (2012).\nSeveral Common Questions\nAnswered\nWhy not simple correlations? To begin with, why are\ncomplex models like SAM needed? Can’t correlations suffice to examine\nquestions of accuracy? After all, the simple Pearson correlation has\nbeen instrumental to the field of personality psychology. Correlations\nare foundational to factor analysis and efforts to uncover the important\ndimensions of basic personality traits such as the Big Five (e.g., John & Srivastava, 1999). Simply\nput, correlational analyses on a single trait — such as the correlation\nbetween self and informant ratings on extraversion — do not provide the\ninferential leverage to examine individual differences in interpersonal\nperception. Such analyses provide a good estimate of the average level\nof self-other agreement for a single trait, but do not allow any insight\ninto whether some perceivers are better than others, whether some\nindividuals are more accurately perceived than others, or whether some\ndyads or pairs are more accurate than others. Although it is possible to\nexamine moderators of accuracy — for instance, to examine whether judges\nhigher in intelligence are more accurate than judges lower in\nintelligence — such analyses are indirect and presume both individual\ndifferences in the good judge and that intelligence is a good proxy for\nthose individual differences. That is, we would only observe assessments\nof judges’ intelligence moderating accuracy if (a) there are individual\ndifferences across judges in their levels of accuracy and (b)\nthe judge’s level of intelligence is associated with their level of\naccuracy. Importantly, the absence of moderation does not imply that the\ngood judge does not exist and there are no meaningful individual\ndifferences in accuracy across judges. However, to really address this\nquestion properly requires a model that allows one to directly\nestimate individual differences in accuracy. This is the reason why I\ndeveloped the social accuracy model. To what extent are there individual\ndifferences in the good judge, the good target, and the good pair or\ndyad? Once these individual or group differences are estimated it\nbecomes easy to examine predictors of these individual differences and\nunderstand those results. If these individual differences in the good\njudge are essentially nil, then there is no point in examining\npredictors of the good judge. If there are strong individual differences\nassociated with accuracy but proposed moderators are not associated with\nthose individual differences, that simply means our theories and\nunderstanding of accuracy and factors associated with accuracy are\nincomplete and we need to look elsewhere to predict and understand those\nindividual differences. Finally, if there are individual differences in\naccuracy across perceivers, targets, and/or dyads, failing to\nappropriately model those individual differences can lead to inflated\nType I error rates and an inability to appropriately generalize results\n(e.g., see Judd et al.,\n2012).\nSAM is a profile analysis. Isn’t this different from\ntrait-level analyses? Distinctive accuracy is computed as\nprofile agreement across a series of items or traits. However, SAM does\nnot just estimate a single dyad’s accuracy but instead considers\nall of the data present across perceivers, targets, and domains\nof personality. Consequently, the fixed effect for distinctive accuracy\n(\\(\\hat{\\gamma}_{10}\\) provides an\nestimate of the average trait-level accuracy across traits (i.e., the\naverage relationship between the validity measure and perceiver ratings\nwhen analyzed separately for each item in the SAM analysis). Kenny & Winquist (2001) and Biesanz (2010) note\nthat variable and person-centered analyses provide the same overall\nsummary of the available data. Indeed, Allik et al. (2015) provide this mathematical\nequivalence for correlations, which requires double standardization\n(both rows and columns). Biesanz (2018) provides an empirical\ndemonstration of how the average level of (unstandardized) distinctive\naccuracy is exactly the same across different units of analysis\nincluding trait/item, perceiver, target, and dyad.1 In\nshort, a profile analysis such as SAM provides one with an estimate of\nthe average level of accuracy observed across perceivers, targets, and\ntraits.\n\n\n\nAllik, J., Borkenau, P., Hřebíčková, M., Kuppens, P., & Realo, A.\n(2015).
